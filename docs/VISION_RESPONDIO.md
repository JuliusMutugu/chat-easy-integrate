# Vision: respond.io as Reference, Nego as Deal-Ready Edge

**Agreed direction:** respond.io is the clear picture of what we envision—with Nego’s edge built in.

---

## What respond.io Represents (Our North Star)

[respond.io](https://respond.io) is an **omnichannel customer conversation management platform** for fast-growing B2C businesses. We use it as the reference for product shape and UX, not as a clone.

### Core model we align with

| Area | respond.io | What we take from it |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| **Channels** | WhatsApp, SMS, Email, Messenger, Instagram, etc. | One place for all conversations; “customers ask on chat, confirm by email”—we do the same with our own engine (no lock-in). |
| **Team Inbox** | Shared inbox, contact management, routing, assignment | Unified view of conversations; contacts and context in one place; team collaboration. |
| **Capture → Convert → Retain** | Leads from ads/social/web, qualification, routing, support, broadcasts | Clear funnel: capture leads, convert (qualify, book, close), retain (support, surveys, promotions). |
| **Workflows & automation** | Visual workflows, triggers, steps, broadcasts | Automation and consistency without building from scratch every time. |
| **Contact management** | Create, search, organize contacts; sidebar with contact details | Contacts as first-class; rich context next to every thread. |

### Tagline we share

Respond.io: *“Customers ask on chat. Call for details. Confirm by email. Can you keep up?”*  
Nego: *“Deal-ready”*—same idea (omnichannel, one place), with **closing and trust** built in.

## Nego’s Edge (Where We Differ)

We are **not** “respond.io with a different logo.” We add:

| Edge | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Deal-first, not just chat** | Live deal block (price, qty, SLA), version history, audit trail. Every term change is recorded; compliance and clarity by default. |
| **Structured messaging** | Redlining, suggested edits, deal_terms widgets, signatures, payment requests—all inside the thread. |
| **Closing infrastructure** | M-Pesa, Stripe, PayPal; smart invoicing (KRA/VAT-ready); e-signatures in-thread. Negotiate and close in one place. |
| **Kenya to World** | Local first (M-Pesa, IPRS, Pesapal) with global rails (Stripe, Onfido). One platform for local and cross-border deals. |
| **Trust layer** | KDPP/GDPR-ready, data export/deletion, RBAC, identity verification (local + global). |

So: **respond.io-style omnichannel inbox and workflows**, plus **negotiation, audit, payments, and e-sign** so conversations can become closed deals without leaving the app.

## How We Get There (From Current Nego)

| respond.io–style target | Current Nego | Next steps |
|-------------------------|--------------|------------|
| Team inbox, one view of all conversations | Rooms + real-time chat | Evolve “Rooms” into a true **inbox** (assign, filter, queues) and add **contacts** (sidebar, profile, history). |
| Multiple channels in one thread | Integrations (Email, SMS, WhatsApp) | Treat channels as first-class: one **contact** can have WhatsApp + SMS + Email; one **conversation** can span channels. |
| Workflows & automation | Manual flows, snippets | Add **workflows** (triggers, steps, routing) and **broadcasts** for campaigns. |
| Capture → Convert → Retain | Rooms, invite links, request-to-join | Formalize **lead capture** (forms, links, codes), **conversion** (routing, qualification, deal panel), **retain** (support, reminders, surveys). |
| AI agents | — | Roadmap: AI agents for qualification, routing, and first-line support (like respond.io). |

We keep our differentiators (deal block, audit trail, redlining, payments, e-sign, Kenya-first) as the core of **Convert** and **Close**, while the overall product shape and workflow follow the respond.io picture.
